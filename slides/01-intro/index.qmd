## Your Background

-   Basic knowledge of R and packages in the tidyverse

-   Basic knowledge of CDISC Standards (ADaM and SDTM Domains)

    -   Check out the [ADaM IG and other documents for CDISC](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/adam)

    -   Check out [admiral](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/cran-release/) and [admiraldiscovery](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldiscovery/articles/reactable.html) for CDISC implementation

-   🦺 However, CDISC knowledge _not_ required, and you will learn! 🦺

-   Goals

    -   Align pharma industry on a set of open source packages based in R to deliver the clinical data pipeline

    -   Design, collaborate, and deliver new solutions where suitable tools do not exist

## E2E Clinical Reporting Packages

## Not that kind of -verse

```{r}
#| error: true
library(pharmaverse)
```

-   The pharmaverse is a collection of open-source tools

-   But we would not want to attempt to load **all of them** at once.

## Industry working on a similar goal

-   Standards (ie CDISC) means standard tools can be created and shared

-   Collaboration in the “post competitive” space means everyone has access to free solutions

-   Team and Regulators seeing consistent packages being used across multiple teams speeds up development and review

## End-to-End with Barb!

Barb is on a journey from raw to TFL.
At various points we will be finding Barb in our data as we transform from Raw to TFL.
