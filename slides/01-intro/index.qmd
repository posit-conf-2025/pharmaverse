## End-to-End Submissions in R with the Pharmaverse

-   Find a seat where you can see the screen!

<!-- TODO: Add link to posit cloud -->

-   Join the Posit Cloud workspace

-   Join the Slack from [pharmaverse.slack.com/](https://pharmaverse.slack.com/)

-   **WiFI**: Posit Conf 2025 \| `conf2025`

## Expected Background

-   Basic knowledge of R and packages in the tidyverse

-   Basic knowledge of CDISC Standards (ADaM and SDTM Domains)

    -   Check out the [ADaM IG and other documents for CDISC](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/adam)

        -   These are great but tome-like!!

    -   Check out [admiral](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/cran-release/) and [admiraldiscovery](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldiscovery/articles/reactable.html) for CDISC implementation

        -   I always like to code immediately to understand a process!

-   ü¶∫ But even lacking CDISC knowledge, we still think you will gain some great learning today! ü¶∫

# Workshop outline

## What to expect from this workshop

-   Learn about what the Pharmaverse is

-   R packages to support Clinical Reporting in R

    -   Create SDTM from raw data (CDASH and non-SDACH formats)

    -   Create ADaM datasets from SDTM

    -   Multiple ways to create tables

    -   Learn about ARDs

-   Hands-on Exercises & Discussions

-   Goals

    -   Align pharma industry on a set of open source packages based in R to deliver the clinical data pipeline

    -   Design, collaborate, and deliver new solutions where suitable tools do not exist

## E2E Clinical Reporting Packages

## Not that kind of -verse

```{r}
#| error: true
library(pharmaverse)
```

-   The pharmaverse is a collection of open-source tools

-   But we would not want to attempt to load **all of them** at once.

## Industry working on a similar goal

-   Standards (ie CDISC) means standard tools can be created and shared

-   Collaboration in the ‚Äúpost competitive‚Äù space means everyone has access to free solutions

-   Team and Regulators seeing consistent packages being used across multiple teams speeds up development and review

## pharmaverse: TRUE or FALSE?

## End to End with Barb!!

  A[Raw] --> B[SDTM]
  B[SDTM] --> C[ADaM]
  C[ADaM] --> D[ARD]
  D[ARD] --> E[TFL]
  
%% Apply the custom class "highlight" to node B
class B highlight;

%% Define the style for the "highlight" class:
classDef highlight fill:#F9B, stroke:#333, stroke-width:2px;  
```

-   Barb is on a journey from raw to TFL.
-   At various points we will be finding Barb in our data as we transform from Raw to TFL.
