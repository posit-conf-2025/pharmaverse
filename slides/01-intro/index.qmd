# Workshop outline

## What to expect from this workshop

-   Learn about what the Pharmaverse is

-   R packages to support Clinical Reporting in R

    -   Create SDTM from raw data (CDASH and non-SDACH formats)

    -   Create ADaM datasets from SDTM

    -   Multiple ways to create tables

    -   Learn about ARDs

-   Hands-on Exercises & Discussions

## Workshop Expectations

## Your Background

-   Basic knowledge of R and packages in the tidyverse

-   Basic knowledge of CDISC Standards (ADaM and SDTM Domains)

    -   Check out the [ADaM IG and other documents for CDISC](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/adam)

    -   Check out [admiral](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/cran-release/) and [admiraldiscovery](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldiscovery/articles/reactable.html) for CDISC implementation

-   ü¶∫ However, CDISC knowledge _not_ required, and you will learn! ü¶∫

-   Goals

    -   Align pharma industry on a set of open source packages based in R to deliver the clinical data pipeline

    -   Design, collaborate, and deliver new solutions where suitable tools do not exist

## E2E Clinical Reporting Packages

<img src="pharmaverse-pkgs.png" style="width: 200px;"/>

## Not that kind of -verse

```{r}
#| error: true
library(pharmaverse)
```

-   The pharmaverse is a collection of open-source tools

-   But we would not want to attempt to load **all of them** at once.

## Industry working on a similar goal

-   Standards (ie CDISC) means standard tools can be created and shared

-   Collaboration in the ‚Äúpost competitive‚Äù space means everyone has access to free solutions

-   Team and Regulators seeing consistent packages being used across multiple teams speeds up development and review

## End-to-End with Barb!

Barb is on a journey from raw data to the TFLs.
At various points we will be finding Barb in our data as we transform from Raw to TFL.

## Working environment

-   For consistency, we will be working in Posit Cloud  

-   Everything has been installed and set up for you 

-   You can also opt to work in local RStudio

-   Following the course, all content from this workshop will be available on the course website and GitHub 


## Quick warm-up

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| cache: false
library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 5, play_sound = TRUE)
```

-   If using Posit Cloud:

    -   Navigate to Posit Cloud link

    -   Click on the Project to make a personal copy
  
-   If using local RStudio:

    -   Exercises can be found here: https://posit-conf-2025.github.io/pharmaverse/exercises/exercises.html

- Open `exercises/01-intro.R`

- Complete the exercise


## Solution for `00-intro.R`

Using dplyr:
 
- From the ADSL dataset:
- Subset to the safety population (SAFFL == "Y")
- calculate the number of unique subjects in each treatment group (TRT01A)  

```{r}
library(dplyr)

pharmaverseadam::adsl |> 
  filter(SAFFL == "Y") |> 
  count(TRT01A)
```
