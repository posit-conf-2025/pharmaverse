## Description

Ready to optimize your regulatory submission process? This workshop offers a practical, end-to-end introduction to using R for a streamlined workflow from raw data to tables, listings, and graphs (TLGs). We'll dive into the power of key R packages from the Pharmaverse, starting with SDTM data preparation; learn to effortlessly map, transform, and validate your data to CDISC standards, ensuring both quality and compliance. Next, create ADaM datasets using modular and pipe-able syntax. Finally, get ready to generate compelling TLGs supported by Analysis Results Datasets (ARDs). We'll explore techniques for producing publication-ready output, customized to meet your specific reporting needs. Walk away with the skills to confidently use R for every stage of the submission process.
